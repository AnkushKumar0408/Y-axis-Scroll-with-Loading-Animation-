# Y-axis-Scroll-with-Loading-Animation

So guys this is 16th project of my 25 days frontend project challenge

This is an amazing affect which is created using function and scrollTrigger by GSAP which is a library of JavaScript 

The effects are page scroll in Y-axis and a loading animation before the main content comes.

When the content scroll in y-axis font family is decreased.

I used HTML, CSS and GSAP(library of JavaScript).
